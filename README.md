# Indigenous Heritage Inventory System

The Indigenous Heritage Inventory System is a console-based application developed in C++ as part of an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course project. This system is designed to manage records related to indigenous heritage, providing an effective way to organize and preserve cultural and natural heritage data.

## Features

- **Heritage Site Management**
  - Create, update, and view detailed profiles for heritage sites.
  
- **Category Organization**
  - Group heritage sites into meaningful categories for easier access and management.
  
- **Preservation Tracking**
  - Record and review preservation efforts and track ongoing initiatives.

- **Core OOP Principles**
  - Implements essential concepts such as:
    - **Abstraction**: Simplifying complex operations into user-friendly functionalities.
    - **Encapsulation**: Protecting sensitive data within classes.
    - **Inheritance**: Reusing common behaviors across different classes.
    - **Polymorphism**: Enabling flexible and dynamic method usage.
    - **Operator Overloading**: Enhancing the functionality of operators for custom types.

## Learning Outcomes

This project allowed me to:
- Develop a deeper understanding of C++ and its OOP features.
- Practice building a structured application with real-world implications.
- Explore the intersection of software development and cultural heritage preservation.
